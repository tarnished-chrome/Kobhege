My dearest and most precious treasure. Please forgive me for not joining you. I know I said that I would follow, but I gave you the last working recoiler. Had you known, you might have decided to stay and share my fate. I could not risk that, so I lied. Try to understand that I only did it so that you might live. The goatfolk will eventually break through the barricades, but I take solace in knowing that you will be far away when they do. Please do not grieve me, or hate me, overly long but find someone who can love you as much as I did. Yours forever and always, Alex.
