A small mod for [Caves of Qud](https://www.cavesofqud.com) that adds a new [True Kin](https://wiki.cavesofqud.com/wiki/True_Kin) caste, a survivor from the fallen arcology of **Kobhege**.

Through item-based storytelling the mod seeks to give the Scrap Merchant caste a more human feel and provide a reason for why they left their arcology. Additionally, in line with the character's own motivation for revenge, the Grudge effect is meant to push the player into targeting goatfolk once they no longer earn XP from other creatures.

Making this mod was a learning experience and I have uploaded it here so that new modders can learn from it. For installation instructions, see [the wiki](https://wiki.cavesofqud.com/wiki/Modding:Overview).
